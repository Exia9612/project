          <p>
            Time would heal almost all wounds . If your wounds have not been healed up , please wait for a short while.
            Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass . it's about learning to dance in the rain.

          <p>
            Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss. But every once in a while you find someone who"s iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare.
            We accept both the good and the bad, andwithout uttering a sound, we continue living.

           <p>
            Nobody can go back and start a new beginning , but anyone can start today and make a new ending.
            The minute you think of giving up , think of the reason why you held on so long .
